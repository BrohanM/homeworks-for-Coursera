					<div class="block-text">The following list of Audi vehicles, including past and present production models, as well as concept vehicles and limited editions. The current era of Audi production dates to 1968, when present-day owner Volkswagen, which had purchased Auto Union from Mercedes Benz in 1965, debuted the first modern Audi-branded vehicles. This revived the Audi nameplate, which was first used in 1910, but was largely supplanted by Auto Union in the 1930s.</div>

							Tesla Motors was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers in Silicon Valley who wanted to prove that electric cars could be better than gasoline-powered cars. With instant torque, incredible power, and zero emissions, Tesla’s products would be cars without compromise. Each new generation would be increasingly affordable, helping the company work towards its mission: to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable transport.
